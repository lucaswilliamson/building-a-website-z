<h1> Why Study Pakistani Language?</h1>
     <p>Although the country of Pakistan might seem relatively homogenous and low in diversity to outsiders, the opposite is quite the truth. According to worldatlas.com, there are six major ethnic groups in the nation today, with 6.2% of the population listed as “other.” Adding to this already complicated framework of cultural identities is the relatively large number of languages spoken commonly throughout the nation: ethnologue lists 74 living languages in total, complete with two official languages and a number of widely spoken provincial languages.

        As Pakistan is highly diverse in terms of ethnolinguistic groups, it is essential to have at least a limited understanding of both the linguistic history as well as the current linguistic distribution in order to truly know the nation. Though Pakistan is united by the common Urdu, it is also important to note that this language serves as a second language to the majority of the population. Those groups that have other languages as their first, apart from ethnic differences, also have very different cultures. It is thus critical to comprehend these differences to understand the history and culture of pakistan altogether.
