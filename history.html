    <h1>Languages of Pakistan: A Brief History</h1>
    <p>The development of the current distribution of languages within Pakistan effectively began with the introduction of Indo-Iranian speakers to the region and the dawn of Vedic culture. This original pastoral conqueror group left behind no known written documents, and so their language is not directly attested. However, linguistic reconstruction techniques have enabled scholars to formulate a reconstructed proto-Indo-Iranian language that is theorized to have been the common ancestor of many of the languages spoken in modern-day Pakistan. The oldest attested written Indo-Iranian language in the area is Vedic Sanskrit, which was a primarily liturgical language for the early Vedic religion, while sister Indo-Iranian languages are attested in modern-day Iran in the form of the Old Iranian languages.</p>
    <p>The Indo-Iranian languages that descend from this proto-Indo-Iranian are further divided into three main groups. The two groups most relevant to Pakistan are the Indo-Aryan languages, which descend from Vedic Sanskrit through Prakrit, and the Iranic languages, which descend from the Old Iranian languages. The primary Indo-Aryan languages spoken in Pakistan today include Urdu, Punjabi, Sindhi, and Saraiki, while the primary Iranic languages include Pashto, Balochi, and Persian.
</p>
    <p>The development of Urdu, one of the stated official languages of Pakistan, is intimately tied with the development of Hindi and can be traced back to the original Muslim conquests of the region by ethnic Persians. It is at this time that both Iranic language and Arabic became established in the area; Persian was spoken as the official language of the government while Arabic was studied in religious contexts. However, Indo-Aryan languages remained the tongue of the common people, and as this common tongue was influenced by the official Iranic Persian language, it developed into the Hindustani language. Modern Hindustani is comprised of a dialect continuum containing both the Pakistani Urdu and the Indian Hindi, and although the two dialects are written with different scripts, their underlying grammar is essentially identical.
</p>
    <p>English was first established in the area as an official language by British colonizers. Although it is considered to be a first language by a minority population of Pakistanis today, it continues to play an important function in post-colonial Pakistan as the other of the two stated official languages of the government.
